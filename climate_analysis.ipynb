    "# Getting starting with SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "- provides a quick way to setup a database engine without requiring a server.\n",
    "    - essentially a flat file (no relationships) with most of the major cababilities of an SQL database\n",
    "- still able to write queries for the database\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLite Advantages \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **It's Local**: allows you to create databases on your local machine to support testing and early prototyping\n",
    "    - this is much easier/faster than setting up a SQL database when testing\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Mobile App Use**: they can be used on a mobile phone app\n",
    "    - most mobile phone games use SQLite database to store info like player stats.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## SQLite Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **It's Local**: MYSQL database allows you to have multiple users. Because SQLite is local, it just lives on your computer - no users. Only that phone or computer can have access to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security**: Doesn't have many security features like a traditional SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python library that helps make queries and communicate between the code and the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary feature of SQLAlchemy is the **Object Relational Mapper**\n",
    "    - allows you to create classes in your code that can be mapped to specific tables in a given database. \n",
    "    - allows you to create a **decoupled system**\n",
    "        - essentially a decoupled system is the opposite of a **tightly coupled system** where everything is related to each other resulting in the possibilty that if one relationship breaks, the whole system breaks.\n",
    "        - allows you to use or access just one facet at a time. \n",
    "- One key aspect here is that the references will be to *classes* rather than specific tables in a database\n",
    "    - can influence each class independently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Create Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `create engine` function allows you to query a SQLite Database\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `create_engine()` function \n",
    "    - this prepares the dateabase file to be connected later one.\n",
    "    - typically has one parameter = location of the SQLite database file\n",
    "    \n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Automap Base\n",
    "\n",
    "- using the `automap_base()` function to reflect the database into a model\n",
    "    - this means transfering the contents of the database into a different structure of data\n",
    "    - creates a base clase for an automap schema in SQLAlchemy - creates the foundation\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Everything so far is to set up the environment for SQLAlchemy\n",
    "    \n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Reflect Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `prepare()` function, you reflect the schema of SQLite tables into our code and create mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you reflect talbes, you create classes that help keep our code separate (decoupled)\n",
    "    - This is important because by keeping code decoupled ensures that if other classes or systems want to interact, they interact **only** with specific subsets of data rather than the whole dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## View Classes Found by Automap\n",
    "\n",
    "- After using the `Base.prepare()` function, confirm tha tthe Automap was able to find all of the data in the SQLite database\n",
    "    - use the `Base.classes.keys()` \n",
    "        - this will reference the classes that were mapped in each table\n",
    "        - `Base.classes` gives acces to all of the classes\n",
    "        - `keys()` references all the names of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **IMPORTANT** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The classes created here help keep the data separate, or decoupled.\n",
    "- The data is now no longer stored in tables but classes.\n",
    "- We can now copy (or reflect) our data into different classes instead of database tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save References to Each table \n",
    "\n",
    "- to referecne a specific clase : `Base.classes.<clase_name>`\n",
    "    - i.e. `Base.classes.station`\n",
    "- You can also store these references as variables (Note that class names are capitalized by convention):\n",
    "    - `Measurement = Base.classes.measurement`\n",
    "    - `Station = Base.classes.station`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Creating a Session Link to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "- use a SQLAlchemy Session to query the database\n",
    "- The session essentially allos us to query the database."
